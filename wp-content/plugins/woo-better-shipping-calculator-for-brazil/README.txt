Shipping calculator for Brazilian WooCommerce stores with automatic Postal Code address pre-filling and Brazilian Market on WooCommerce.

== Description ==

Improved shipping calculator designed specifically for **Brazilian e-commerce stores using [WooCommerce](https://www.linknacional.com.br/wordpress/woocommerce/)**, making it easier and significantly improving the data entry flow on the cart and checkout pages.

This version includes **full compatibility with Shortcodes and Gutenberg themes**, allowing you to place the shipping calculator anywhere on your site with maximum flexibility.

This [WordPress](https://www.linknacional.com.br/wordpress/) plugin ensures faster address verification and cleaner form management, leading to a better user experience and fewer abandoned carts.

## 🚀 New Features: Complete Brazilian Checkout

We have expanded the plugin capabilities to offer a full checkout solution for the Brazilian market. Now, in addition to the shipping calculator, the plugin manages **Custom Checkout Fields** essential for Brazilian logistics and invoicing.

**New Field Features:**
* **CPF & CNPJ:** Adds fields for Individual (CPF) and Company (CNPJ) Tax IDs with automatic validation.
* **Address Fields:** Adds and manages specific fields for **Neighborhood (Bairro)**, **Number**, and **Complement**.
* **Phone Masks:** Intelligent input masking for Brazilian landlines and mobile phones.

### ✅ ERP & "Brazilian Market" Compatibility

This is a major update for store owners who need to issue invoices (Nota Fiscal). The plugin is now fully compatible with the data standards used by the **Brazilian Market on WooCommerce** plugin (by Claudio Sanches).

**Why is this important?**
1.  **Bling & ERP Integration:** Because we follow the standard meta-keys structure, this plugin is **fully compatible with Bling, Tiny**, and other ERPs that integrate with WooCommerce. You can issue invoices (NFe) seamlessly without data errors.
2.  **Standardized Data:** Ensures that CPF, CNPJ, and address data are saved exactly how external integration tools expect them.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin replace "Brazilian Market on WooCommerce"? =

Yes, this plugin acts as an updated solution for *Brazilian Market on WooCommerce*. It maintains full compatibility with existing data but offers improved features. **Note:** To use it, you must disable the *Brazilian Market on WooCommerce* plugin (by Claudio Sanches) to avoid field conflicts.

= How can I CHANGE the text "Calculate shipping"? =

Use the following code:

add_filter(
	'wc_better_shipping_calculator_for_brazil_postcode_label',
	function () {
		return 'your new text';
	}
);

= How can I REMOVE the text "Calculate shipping"? =

Use the following code:

add_filter(
	'wc_better_shipping_calculator_for_brazil_postcode_label',
	'__return_null'
);

= Why is the Phone field now mandatory and asking for a Country Code (DDI)? =

This feature was added to ensure all essential customer contact data is complete and correctly formatted. The DDI (Dialing Code International) ensures the phone number is standardized for both national and international calls, which is crucial for logistics and customer service. You can disable this feature in the plugin settings under the Checkout tab.

= How does the automatic address lookup by CEP work? =

When the customer enters a valid 8-digit CEP (Brazilian postcode) on the checkout page, the plugin uses public APIs (like VIACEP and Brasil API) to automatically retrieve and fill in the Street, City, State, and Neighborhood fields, speeding up the checkout process.
